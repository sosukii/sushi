Header Behavior by width

Application, where you can see **How the header works** (the top of the page with site navigation):
1. with a *large screen width*, menu items are shown in one row;
2. with a very *small screen width*, the navigation elements (menu) are hidden under the "burger" button

###Demonstration of works:
full width:
![full-width](./img/md/full-width.png)

small-width:

small-width, when you tap the burger-button:
![small-width__button](./img/md/small-width__open-menu.png)
